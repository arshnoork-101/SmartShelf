# SMART SHELF
## Seneca Hackathon 2025
### ðŸ›’ Problem & Solution
Problem: Grocery stores rely on manual product expiry checks, leading to errors, inefficiencies, and food waste. Employees must physically inspect items, increasing labor costs and operational delays.

Solution: Our Smart Shelf System automates expiry tracking by scanning barcodes and updating a digital grid. Each productâ€™s expiry status is color-coded in real-time, ensuring soon-to-expire items are placed at the front and no expired products remain on shelves.

The data collected would allow store operator to monitor expiry trends for each product individually. This helps optimize reordering decisions, ensuring better inventory management and reducing waste.
